- Support prepared statements (To avoid SQL injection).

- Use a smaller scope. 

- Declare con only once, not at the start of each function.
  
- Remove the code duplication at the start and end of every function. 

- Keep C++98 compatible and not use C++11's smart pointers. maybe std::auto_ptr to make the code exception safe.

- Delete-lines are never run if an exception is thrown... (Fix it).

-  Write docs.
